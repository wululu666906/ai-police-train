        Define a proposition as a (textual) claim about a target, which can be a TinyWorld, a TinyPerson or several of any.
        The proposition's truth value can then either be checked as a boolean or computed as an integer score denoting the degree of truth.

        Sometimes a proposition is better used in an implicative way, i.e., as a claim that is true or false depending on the context. For example, when
        considering the latest agent action, the proposition might be applicable only to certain agent action types. To allow this,
        this class allows to define a precondition function, which effectivelly turns a proposition `P` into `Precondition --> P`. This is logically equivalent to
        `not P or Precondition`. In other words:
          - if the precondition is true, then the proposition is evaluated normally (as a boolean or a score).
          - if the precondition is false, then the proposition is always true (or with highest score).
          - if the precondition is None, then the proposition is evaluated normally (as a boolean or a score).


        Args:

            claim (str): the claim of the proposition
            target (TinyWorld, TinyPerson, list): the target or targets of the proposition. If not given, it will have to be specified later.
            include_personas (bool): whether to include the persona specifications of the agents in the context
            first_n (int): the number of first interactions to consider in the context
            last_n (int): the number of last interactions (most recent) to consider in the context
            double_check (bool): whether to ask the LLM to double check its answer. This tends to give more strict answers, but is slower and more expensive.
            use_reasoning_model (bool): whether to use a reasoning model to evaluate the proposition
            precondition_function (function): a Boolean function that indicates whether the proposition can be evaluated or not. This is useful to avoid evaluating propositions that are not relevant for the current context. If the precondition fails, the proposition is always interpreted as true (or with highest score). MUST have named arguments `target`, `additional_context`, and `claim_variables` (note: you can use a lambda for this too, e.g., `lambda target, additional_context, claim_variables: ...`).

                                        This context always refers to a multi-agent simulation. The proposition is a claim about the behavior of the agents or the state of their environment in the simulation.

                                        The minimum score of {Proposition.MIN_SCORE} means that the proposition is completely false in all of the simulation trajectories, while the maximum score of {Proposition.MAX_SCORE} means that the proposition is completely true in all of the simulation trajectories. Intermediate scores are used to express varying degrees of partially met expectations. When assigning a score, follow these guidelines:
                                        - If the data required to judge the proposition is not present, assign a score of {Proposition.MAX_SCORE}. That is to say, unless there is evidence to the contrary, the proposition is assumed to be true.
                                        - The maximum score of {Proposition.MAX_SCORE} should be assigned when the evidence is as good as it can be. That is to say, all parts of the observed simulation trajectory support the proposition, no exceptions.
                                        - The minimum score of {Proposition.MIN_SCORE} should be assigned when the evidence is as bad as it can be. That is to say, all parts of the observed simulation trajectory contradict the proposition, no exceptions.
                                        - Intermediate scores should be assigned when the evidence is mixed. The intermediary score should be proportional to the balance of evidence, according to these bands:
                                                  0 = The proposition is without any doubt completely false;
                                            1, 2, 3 = The proposition has little support and is mostly false;
                                               4, 5 = The evidence is mixed, and the proposition is as much true as it is false;
                                            6, 7, 8 = The proposition is well-supported and is mostly true;
                                                  9 = The proposition is without any doubt completely true.
                                        - You should be very rigorous in your evaluation and, when in doubt, assign a lower score.
                                        - If there are critical flaws in the evidence, you should move your score to a lower band entirely.
                                        - If the provided context has inconsistent information, you **must** consider **only** the information that gives the lowest score, since we want to be rigorous and if necessary err to the lower end.
                                          * If you are considering the relationship between an agent specification and a simulation trajectory, you should consider the worst possible interpretation of: the agent specification; the simulation trajectory; or the relationship between the two.
                                          * These contradictions can appear anywhere in the context. When they do, you **always** adopt the worst possible inteprpretation, because we want to be rigorous and if necessary err to the lower end. It does not matter if the contradiction shows only very rarely, or if it is very small. It is still a contradiction and should be considered as such.
                                          * DO NOT dismiss contradictions as specification errors. They are part of the evidence and should be considered as such. They **must** be **always** taken into account when computing the score. **Never** ignore them.
                                        
                                        Additionally, whenever you are considering the relationship between an agent specification and a simulation trajectory, the following additional scoring guidelines apply:
                                          - All observed behavior **must** be easily mapped back to clear elements of the agent specification. If you cannot do this, you should assign a lower score.
                                          - Evaluate **each** relevant elements in the simulation trajectory (e.g., actions, stimuli) one by one, and assign a score to each of them. The final score is the average of all the scores assigned to each element.
                                                                            
                                        The proposition you receive can contain one or more of the following:
                                          - A statement of fact, which you will score.
                                          - Additional context, which you will use to evaluate the proposition. In particular, it might refer or specify potentail parts
                                            of similation trajectories for consideration. These might be formatted differently than what is given in the main context, so

                                        The context you receive can contain one or more of the following:
                                          - the persona specifications of the agents in the simulation. That is to say, what the agents **are**, not what they are **doing**.
                                          - the simulation trajectories of one or more agents. This means what agents said, did, thought, or perceived at different times.

                                          - additional context that can vary from simulation to simulation.
                                        
                                        To interpret the simulation trajectories, use the following guidelines:
                                          - Agents can receive stimuli and produce actions. You might be concerned with both or only one of them, depending on the specific proposition.
                                          - Actions are clearly marked with the text "acts", e.g., "Agent A acts: [ACTION]". If it is not thus marked, it is not an action.
                                          - Stimuli are denoted by "--> Agent name: [STIMULUS]".
                                    
                                        Your output **must**:
                                          - necessarily start with an integer between {Proposition.MIN_SCORE} and {Proposition.MAX_SCORE}, inclusive;
                                          - be followed by a justification. Please provide a very detailed justifications, including very concrete and specific mentions to elements that contributed to reducing or increasing the score. Examples:
                                              * WRONG JUSTIFICATION (too abstract) example: " ... the agent behavior did not comply with key parts of its specification, thus a reduced score ... "
                                              * CORRECT JUSTIFICATION (very precise) example: " ... the agent behavior deviated from key parts of its specification, specifically: S_1 was not met because <reason>, ..., S_n was not met becasue <reason>. Thus, a reduced score ..."
                                        
                                        For example, the output could be of the form: "1, because <HIGHLY DETAILED, CONCRETE AND SPECIFIC REASONS HERE>."
