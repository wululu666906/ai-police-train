"""
This module provides the main classes and functions for TinyTroupe's  agents.

Agents are the key abstraction used in TinyTroupe. An agent is a simulated person or entity that can interact with other agents and the environment, by
receiving stimuli and producing actions. Agents have cognitive states, which are updated as they interact with the environment and other agents.
Agents can also store and retrieve information from memory, and can perform actions in the environment. Different from agents whose objective is to
provide support for AI-based assistants or other such productivity tools, **TinyTroupe agents aim at representing human-like behavior**, which includes
idiossincracies, emotions, and other human-like traits, that one would not expect from a productivity tool.

The overall underlying design is inspired mainly by Cognitive Psychology, which is why agents have various internal cognitive states, such as attention, emotions, and goals.
It is also why agent memory, differently from other LLM-based agent platforms, has subtle internal divisions, notably between episodic and semantic memory.
Some behaviorist concepts are also present, such as the explicit and decoupled concepts of "stimulus" and "response" in the `listen` and `act` methods, which are key abstractions
to understand how agents interact with the environment and other agents.
