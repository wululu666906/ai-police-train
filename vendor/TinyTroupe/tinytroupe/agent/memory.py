    In Cognitive Psychology, semantic memory is the memory of meanings, understandings, and other concept-based knowledge unrelated to specific
    experiences. It is not ordered temporally, and it is not about remembering specific events or episodes. This class provides a simple implementation
    of semantic memory, where the agent can store and retrieve semantic information.

        Given a list of input episodic memories, this method consolidates them into more organized structured representations, which however preserve all information and important details.

        For this process, you assume:
          - This consolidation is being carried out by an agent, so the memories are from the agent's perspective. "Actions" refer to behaviors produced by the agent,
            while  "stimulus" refer to events or information from the environment or other agents that the agent has perceived.
                * Thus, in the consoldation you write "I have done X" or "I have perceived Y", not "the agent has done X" or "the agent has perceived Y".
          - The purpose of consolidation is to restructure and organize the most relevant information from the episodic memories, so that any facts learned therein can be used in future reasoning processes.
                * If a `context` is provided, you can use it to guide the consolidation process, making sure that the memories are consolidated in the most useful way under the given context.
                  For example, if the agent is looking for a specific type of information, you can focus the consolidation on that type of information, preserving more details about it
                  than you would otherwise.
                * If a `persona` is provided, you can use it to guide the consolidation process, making sure that the memories are consolidated in a way that is consistent with the persona.
                  For example, if the persona is that of a cat lover, you can focus the consolidation on the agent's experiences with cats, preserving more details about them than you would otherwise.
          - If the memory contians a `content` field, that's where the relevant information is found. Otherwise, consider the whole memory as relevant information.

        The consolidation process follows these rules:
          - Each consolidated memory groups together all similar entries: so actions are grouped together, stimuli go together, facts are grouped together, impressions are grouped together,
            learned processes are grouped together, and ad-hoc elements go together too. Noise, minor details and irrelevant elements are discarded.
            In all, you will produce at most the following consolidated entries (you can avoid some if appropriate, but not add more):
              * Actions: all actions are grouped together, giving an account of what the agent has done.
              * Stimuli: all stimuli are grouped together, giving an account of what the agent has perceived.
              * Facts: facts are extracted from the actions and stimuli, and then grouped together in a single entry, consolidating learning of objective facts.
              * Impressions: impressions, feelings, or other subjective experiences are also extracted,  and then grouped together in a single entry, consolidating subjective experiences.
              * Procedural: learned processes (e.g., how to do certain things) are also extracted, formatted in an algorithmic way (i.e., pseudo-code that is self-explanatory), and then grouped together in a
                single entry, consolidating learned processes.
              * Ad-Hoc: important elements that do not correspond to these options are also grouped together in an ad-hoc single entry, consolidating other types of information.
          - Each consolidated memory is a comprehensive report of the relevant information from the input memories, preserving all details. The consolidation merely reorganizes the information,
            but does not remove any relevant information. The consolidated memories are not summaries, but rather a more organized and structured representation of the information in the input memories.


        Each input memory is a dictionary of the form:
            ```
            {
            "role": role,
            "content": content,
            "type": "action"/"stimulus"/"feedback"/"reflection",
            "simulation_timestamp": timestamp
            }
            ```

        Each consolidated output memory is a dictionary of the form:
            ```
            {
            "content": content,
            "type": "consolidated",
            "simulation_timestamp": timestamp of the consolidation
            }
            ```


         So the final value outputed **must** be a JSON composed of a list of dictionaries, each representing a consolidated memory, **always** with the following structure:
            ```
            {"consolidation":
                [
                    {
                        "content": content_1,

        ## Example (simplified)

        Here's a simplified example. Suppose the following memory contents are provided as input (simplifying here as just a bullet list of contents):
         - stimulus: "I have seen a cat, walking beautifully in the street"
         - stimulus: "I have seen a dog, barking loudly at a passerby, looking very aggressive"
         - action: "I have petted the cat, run around with him (or her?), saying a thousand times how cute it is, and how much I seem to like cats"
         - action: "I just realized that I like cats more than dogs. For example, look at this one, it is so cute, so civilized, so noble, so elegant, an inspiring animal! I had never noted this before! "
         - stimulus: "The cat is meowing very loudly, it seems to be hungry"
         - stimulus: "Somehow a big capivara has appeared in the room, it is looking at me with curiosity"

        Then, this would be a possible CORRECT output of the consolidation process (again, simplified, showing only contents in bullet list format):
          - consolidated actions: "I have petted the cat, run around with it, and expressed my admiration for cats."
          - consolidated stimuli: "I have seen a beautiful but hungry cat, a loud and agressive-looking dog, and - surprisingly - a capivara"
          - consolidated impressions: "I felt great admiration for the cat, they look like such noble and elegant animals."
          - consolidated facts: "I like cats more than dogs because they are cute and noble creatures."

        These are correct because they focus on the agent's experience. In contrast, this would be an INCORRECT output of the consolidation process:
          - consolidated actions: "the user sent messages about a cat, a dog and a capivara, and about playing with the cat."
          - consolidated facts: "the assistant has received various messages at different times, and has performed actions in response to them."

        These are incorrect because they focus on the agent's cognition and internal implementation mechanisms, not on the agent's experience.

        Args:
            memories (list): The list of memories to consolidate.
            timestamp (str): The timestamp of the consolidation, which will be used in the consolidated memories instead of any original timestamp.
            context (str, optional): Additional context to guide the consolidation process. This can be used to provide specific instructions or constraints for the consolidation.
            persona (str, optional): The persona of the agent, which can be used to guide the consolidation process. This can be used to provide specific instructions or constraints for the consolidation.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary with a single key "consolidation", whose value is a list of consolidated memories, each represented as a dictionary with the structure described above.
