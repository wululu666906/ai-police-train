        Initializes the ActionGenerator.

        Args:
            max_attempts (int): The maximum number of attempts to generate an action.
            enable_quality_checks (bool): Whether to perform quality checks on the generated action. If False, the first action generated
              is returned without any checks.
            enable_regeneration (bool): Whether to try to make the agent regenerate the action if the first attempt fails.
            enable_direct_correction (bool): Whether to directly correct the action if the first attempt fails, without asking the agent to regenerate it.
            enable_quality_check_for_persona_adherence (bool): Whether to check the action for persona adherence.
            enable_quality_check_for_selfconsistency (bool): Whether to check the action for self-consistency.
            enable_quality_check_for_fluency (bool): Whether to check the action for fluency.
            enable_quality_check_for_suitability (bool): Whether to check the action for suitability.
            continue_on_failure (bool): Whether to return the last tentative action, even if it fails to pass quality checks.
               Presumably, the last tentative action is the one that is most likely to be correct, since it has gone through the most iterations of regeneration and correction.
            quality_threshold (int): The minimum score for each quality check for the action to be considered good quality.
            enable_reasoning_step (bool): Whether to enable reasoning step in the action generation process. This IS NOT the use of "reasoning models" (e.g., o1, o3),
              but rather the use of an additional reasoning step in the regular text completion.
            enable_multi_action_output (bool): If True, the LLM is expected to output the full sequence of actions for the turn (ending with DONE).

                                WARNING! TENTATIVE ACTION GENERATION FAILED IN QUALITY CHECKS!

                                You were about to produce the following action(s), as a sequence for the previous actions or feedbacks (if any):
                                      ```
                                      {previous_tentative_action}
                                      ```
                                   
                                However, it failed to pass the quality checks (as described in the quality feedback below), and therefore it was aborted and not added
                                to the simulation trajectory.

                                Now you **must** try again to generate a **BETTER** action or sequence of actions, such that the quality issues mentioned in the feedback are addressed,
                                or instead issue a DONE action and stop for this turn if it is unclear how to improve quality. 
                                Your objective is to **PASS** the quality checks this time if possible.

                                You can choose either to FIX somehow the action(s) you were about to produce, or to generate something COMPLETELY NEW and DIFFERENT.  
                                Each time your tentative action fail a quality check, you should be MORE RADICAL in your changes, and try to produce 
                                something that is **very** different from the previous attempts.

                                If it is unclear how to produce a better action, you can choose to issue a DONE action instead. 
                                **It is better to stop acting than to act poorly.**
                                
                                In general, desireable properties of the action are:
                                  - The action is consistent with the agent's persona, it is what one would expect from the agent given its persona.
                                  - The action is self-consistent, it does contradict the agent's previous actions.
                                  - The action is fluent and natural, and does not repeat itself or use overly formulaic language.
                                
                                {feedback_from_previous_attempt}
